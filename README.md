<h1>Business 310 (Data Science/Decision Science) Project</h1>

<h2>By Keanu Valencia</h2>

<p>This Repository will be used to document my work for my second BUS 310 Project.</p>

<p>Start Date: 9/14/24</p>
<p>Finish Date: </p>

<p>For this project, I will use Python to create a scatter plot in order to make predictions. I will also calculate the Correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the relationship between the two varibles being graphed. The end goal is to create a presentation to report my findings.</p>
